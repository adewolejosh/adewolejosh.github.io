### Intro
---

Ever wondered how your favorite engineers automate their python stuffs, I do! From time to time it hits me with some form of impostor syndrome- _"Am I that good enough"_, oh well, you know what? you don't have to be good enough, you're excellent enough so get those hands dirty, will you! Moving on to the subject. So for us to automate we need some key code e.g

```sh
python3 -m pip install python
```

```py
print("I love you!")
```

```js
function ArraylengthFinder(){
    array = new Array()
    console.log(array.length())
}
```
