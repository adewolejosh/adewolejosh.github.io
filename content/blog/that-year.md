Youâ€™ll decide what you want and it will happen; your life will be bathed in light. To those who feel low youâ€™ll say, â€˜Chin up! Be brave!â€™ and God will save them. Yes, even the guilty will escape, escape through Godâ€™s grace in your life."'

### In the beginning

Random: This is 12:03pm on the 31st of December, 2022; Listening to Tom Odell's "Best Day of My Life" Song, after listening to Maroon5's "Memories" and Jaymes Young's "Happiest Year". Which is wayyy too paradoxical, considering how this year has been. N.B: the following you're about to read is a rush through of my year- I am definitely not the fastest typist but I can tell I am rushing this off..., need to get this out TODAY! Also the article's picture was one of my many failed projects this year, lol.

No cap, I know we all had so much expectation for this year, but to be honest it's just like every year, we always have an expectation of some sort. There's something I always say: "Every 'similar' thing is equal: in essesnce all humans are equal but to a varying degree"- here's what I mean, A human having 100 naira and a human having 20 naira, both are equal but in terms of their degree of money, there's a varying degree. Well that's just a perspective, yet I still believe all fingers are not equal. Long story short, a lot happened to a lot of us this year, 2022.

### Re-cap

Rush through of my year, 

<b>January</b>: was at a previous job as a remote part-time Flutter mobile app developer, doing school and work, at a time where every single lecturer threw group term papers, like wind. Was a crazy time, really crazy, and may I say, imagine using a DELL laptop, which is pretty olddd and running flutter, you don't want to know the round of tears and prayers I went through. 

<b>February</b>: Got my first technical interview, which I blew up and I still feel angry about everyday: I know we shouldn't give excuses and there is really not substantial excuse to give but Not exaggerating, From February to August, Nigeria literally happened to me, black-outs left-right, national grid collapsing and power outage for the most part, literally managed to prepare, somehow managed to even attend the interview. So many things to say about that but lets just say: "Kashamadupe". ASUU strink from "Falentine" 14/2 till probably mid-September, WILD. 

<b>March</b>: (or thereabout) spent sometime with someone (sorry can't  go into details). Crazy time and March 3rd or thereabout was my last time at my Flutter Job: They needed someone full-time and <b>probably</b> in South-America. 

<b>April</b>: "Kashamadupe" Lots of close people passing away, crazy! 

<b>May</b>: Can't remember much but also still applying for interviews, getting tasks, doing them and not getting any feedback or not even hearing anything at all, wild. 

Same (and some other personal things came up) with June, July, August... 

<b>September</b>: Cried myself to sleep with prayer, some real stuff went on, almost made me write a book, but somehow I didn't get past the title. Semptember: School called off strike, just when everyone seemed to get their stuff together and a lot of people came back fully in October. 

<b>October</b>: Permit me to say a big thank you to God, and thank you also to Yemi. Was my birthday month, got a new job, which I have been looking for since like forever- writing python for a living... doing that with school; Got myself and my twin sister something for our birthday! Made me happy. 

<b>November</b>: Saw a long time brother, almost missed him though cause I got home just as he was leaving. Major highlight was starting this Journal: my days... So I started journaling from about Nov. 2 using <a href="notion.so" target="_blank">Notion.so</a>, how I went about it: for each day, I had date, morning dose with time stamp and evening dose with time stamp, consistently pouring my every day life, felt like therapy, and the most amazing of all was IT FELT REAL- GOD'S EYES ARE ON THAT JOURNAL, imagine writing prayers little as: "God, the sun scorches me, on my way to school everyday, please take it away" and literally, the clouds cover up the sun, without rain falling anf there's this sudden cool breeze flowing. WILD! 

<b>December</b>: Here we are- had exams, I really don't wish to talk about. So much happened and some how I think I have been suppressing my memory on so many things right from childhood. I definitely need ... (filtered, sorry). Just past few days, I began sumn: Set an alarm for 12 mid-day, this has helped me to gain consciousness of time, at the sound of the alarm I question myself on how far I have covered today's tasks, you should try it. Started playing CODM yesterday and I must say, I need more steady hands, How does <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@geniuscodm" target="_blank">"Genius"</a> (A friend of mine) do it. Well about my favorite thing Chess: haven't made so much progress, still on the 2k ish point, also started streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kunmijo " target="_blank">twitch!!! @kunmijo</a>kindly follow, I play chess, dream league soccer and sometimes practice leetcode- pretty much started it to gain interview confidence, well got about 9 followers in about 36 broadcasts.

A lot happened: just like with everyone else. Random: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34WI9hCaE3AzbOYT9wFXLP?si=ad2b246e54804aa7" target="_blank">"High and Low" by Empire of the sun</a> is playing on my spotify! Loved this song since the days of FIFA 17, lol. Unrelated but, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2dssFgPLHm6Y1mINk3JNJ8?si=vfyXJgj5Tjmfwkh77qhrFA" target="_blank">Album of the year, by the way</a>. This was such a long read. If you got this far: Thank you, you're a "warrior" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ - you're able to persevere anything, trust me. 2023 definitely going to be a great year, I trust God on that. I told myself I was going to call all my contacts this year, not sure I went through a quarter: <a href="https://twitter.com/introvertsmemes/status/1608640024052109312?s=20" target="_blank">here's a reason</a>, but seriously ðŸ˜…, I need to improve my interaction with everyone. By the way, still receiving christmas presents and gifts (didn't receive any though): <a href="https://barter.me/joshuaadewole4649?currency=USD" target="_blank">monetary-dollars</a>, <a href="https://barter.me/joshuaadewole4649" target="_blank">monetary-naira</a>, <a href="mailto:adewole.josh@gmail.com" target="_blank">encouragements</a>.
