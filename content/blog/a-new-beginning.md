quote: '"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace."'

### Nineteen
---

Today, I turn 19. It's a crazy feeling for me- being a year older added to the fact that in reality I'm getting older, lol who doesn't get Older. All in all, I am still thankful and very grateful (In all things give thanks [egw])- for the things I've achieved, the things I haven't, great Friends I've met, great Friendships created, Friendships that were once great, Family, Home, for Life, for God being God. I honestly have not words but to be thankful.

### The Past
---

In all honesty, this Last Decade, I made quite a lot of (I'd rather not say mistakes) wrong decisions, I really do not regret it, cause it all brought about great lessons. I definitely can't start mentioning it all out, but as I try to write "this" out I'm trying to work on self-healing, I mean, Time does heal but does it entirely heal; there has always got to be sores after the wound literally. To everyone I've met in this world, I am sorry. One way or another I feel like I owe everyone and everything I know, an apology- I am deeply sorry, to the ones I've hurt, to the ones that hurt me. I just really needed to say this all out to move on.

### The Future
---

Dear Future, I really don't know what you hold, but one thing is for sure- IT ALL LIES IN THE HAND OF GOD. I recall a verse that says, take no thought for tomorrow that the "evil" of today is sufficient for today; it really is. I'll do my best to work harder, pray harder and push harder no matter what, and would definitely see It all roll out interestingly, in joy, peace, happiness and fulfillment.

### The Present
---

Lately, I really can't figure out what is going on- am I the one distancing out from everyone or Is everyone just distancing from me or both. Crazy how I wake up each day and without thinking, I really do not bother checking my texts or socials, cause I don't get any message except from groups and stuff- Peace of mind, one might say. It gets even crazier when no group chat message comes in and I'm like: "What then is the point of socials?" Based on that I actually feel like I may need to make more friends and all or maybe I should just try working on the frienships I have. Yet, me(as a normal Overthinker) really feels like I've carried way too many ships single-handedly and I just can become a burden and all of that, you get me yeah? It's just really crazy being me sometimes.

Sorry you had to read the story of my Life. A New Beginning- Made Peace with my Past, Let Go of the Future and Making the best out of the Present. I really hope with this new age comes more great stuff, all my hopes and dreams come alive(including that of everyone around me). I'll try my best to come out of my layersss of shells, make new and incredible friends, spend some time at the gym, make the most of my time ; Just generally Make the most of Life- spiritually, physically, mentally, financially et all and Remain Positive. So help me God!
