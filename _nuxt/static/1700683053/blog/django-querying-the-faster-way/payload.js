Django filter provided this method for use when filtering, just in case you wanted to sort it by whatever field. Unfortunately when used on a data of over 100k rows (approximately 100 columns), it\nbrought about a great lag; An alternative is, get the records, or simply use the .filter() and use python's .sorted() to do that. Although, I didn't compare what happens with more data, I mean, what are the odds- it is better in a longer time or sumn. Well, that's our first: python's .sorted() over django .order_by()."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"You probably know this if you've used django for long: using .values() and .values_list() (with sometimes .values_list(Flat=True) to flatten the result) this helps in resolving your filtered data into a dictionary and array\u002Flist respectively and reducing the amount of data being returned, instead of retrieving every data in every column of every row, you use this to instantly select\u002Fpick the columns you need from every row. In some ways this make your querying faster although the trade-off I see is, being expected to manage the columns you need manually I guess.
