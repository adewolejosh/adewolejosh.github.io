Also, finally won a medal (for the first time in my life) - reading this, some might relate to my experience whilst some are pretty much out of touch but it's fine: ever since I could remember, I would always want to participate in sports and overall at School, would want to represent a house at interhouse sport or something but every single time it was either one of this three outcomes - A teacher discards me for my looks (I've never bothered to change that) or I am just scrapped out at preliminaries (skill issues, I know), or I am just not so lucky to be picked for a sport or something.

Personally, will be committing to doing more algo and CP in general and importantly, more engineering in 2025 - I took a whole break, literally, from Jan. '24 - Dec '24, although I got started a bit on that but hoping to do a lot more, also diving into OS and WÂ³ is pretty much on my radar.
