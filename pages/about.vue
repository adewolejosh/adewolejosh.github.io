                    Hi, I am Joshua Adewole. I am a self-taught software developer with experience in: 'bringing to life' UI designs, writing good server-side
                    solutions in Python and JavaScript, and professionally building mobile apps with the thought of over tens of thousands of users from over 5
                    countries. I sometimes write; other times, I design(although I am not cut out for this but I still try to make some meaning). Here's a quick
                    look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGkXLuzm_Rir-n6i1lnwgtECMC9HGQzq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115828739539076750598&rtpof=true&sd=true">my resume</a>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    I am currently open to Backend roles(especially with python [My love for python is out of this world]), Frontend roles(I love Vue so much!), 
                    Full-stack roles(It would be an Ultimate ecstacy to build a product involving Python(Django/Flask) and VueJs) and/or Mobile app roles(I learnt 
                    Flutter/Dart and it was shocking to know, mobile app development isn't so difficult as I had thought).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently in my penultimate undergraduate year at the University of Lagos, studying Systems Engineering. I love Mathematics
                    (and generally solving problems), good music, cycling and other cool stuff. I don't think I am the life of the party but I sure bring good humor. 
                    When needed, I take communication very seriously (e.g In a team environment). Generally I'm just a cool guy, you'd love to meet (Trust me).
                    I have been involved in some instances of public speaking (Feel free to hit me up if you need a speaker at any event).
                </p>
