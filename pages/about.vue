                    Hi there, I'm Joshua Adewole. I'm a Software Engineer with experience writing server and client side solutions in Python and JavaScript.
                    I sometimes design and write- mostly undocumented materials which I hope to change from now(at the time of writing). I'm currently Open to Backend
                    and/or Fullstack Engineering roles, here's <a  target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZhml6tSsuClQ7wn2kniYsUlJkNhI_IjCY1RI_zbptI/edit?usp=sharing">My Resume</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I currently have my BSc Systems Engineering at the University of Lagos in view. I love Mathematics(and generally solving problems),
                    good music, cycling and other cool stuff. I don't think I am the life of the party but I sure bring good humor. When needed, I take
                    communication very seriously (e.g In a team environment). Generally I'm just a cool guy, you'd love to meet (Trust me).
                    I have been involved in some instances of public speaking (Feel free to hit me up if you need a speaker at any event). In a few years
                    from now I hope to see myself as a Lead and possibly diving into Software Testing.

                    I started out coding in Python 2, created word games on my little Techno M3 Phone- most of my friends claim my games were hard.
                    With the help of the book "Learn Python the hard Way" I was able to get used to the Python syntax and then I switched into Python 3,
                    after which I decided to go for web development- Django; on this path I was able to learn django, HTML, CSS and JavaScript extensively.
                    Built quite a number of web apps with this stack; even worked on some Team project(s).

                    Thereafter I made a decision to work on my JavaScript as it seemed to be a very interesting language- which it is. I then took some Hackerrank
                    challenges and with the help of a Friend and a recommended book, "Eloquent JavaScript", I garnered more knowledge on JavaScript.
                    Vue Js was calling out to me (literally), I researched about it; for its simplicity, neat and lovely style of code, I took it up. Much thanks to
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a> whose tutorial got me up and running Vue. With that I then made Budget-go.

                    My Journey so far has been great, quite a number of hurdles here and there, but I'm so thankful for where I am. As time goes on, I'll be
                    recounting my experiences, writing tutorials and many other writing expressions on <nuxt-link to="/blog">My Blog.</nuxt-link> Feel free
                    to give it a read and a comment via mail to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:adewole.josh@gmail.com">adewole.josh@gmail.com</a> is very much appreciated and would
                    definitely be replied.
